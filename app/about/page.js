      <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none mt-6 text-zinc-300">
        <p><strong>Origins in the Bronx:</strong> Quadlibét was born in the Bronx in 1985, the brainchild of cousins Roger and Darryl Alexander, inspired by the earliest wave of Freestyle and artists like Shannon, Lisa Fischer, Lisa Lisa, Jenny Burton, C-Bank, and Loleatta Holloway.</p>
        <p>That same year the group teamed with producer Ancil Cox to record the first version of “Take Me I’m Yours,” with Giselle on lead and Roger, Darryl, and David on background vocals. Though a demo, it marked the start of a lasting dance legacy. The group paused in 1987 as life commitments took over, but the music never stopped.</p>
        <p><strong>Evolution:</strong> Through solo work, collaborations, and a pivotal 1988 Freestyle resurgence, Quadlibét re-emerged, performed across iconic venues, and later released music with Artistik and Tazmania. Today, Roger Alexander, Moses Lopez, and Bruce Ortiz remain the heart of Quadlibét, joined by Rogelio Aponte, a longtime collaborator known for production, melody arrangements, and songwriting.</p>
        <p><strong>Now:</strong> Bronx-born rhythm with modern energy — Quadlibét continues to write, record, and evolve.</p>
